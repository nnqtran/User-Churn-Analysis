# [POWER BI] User Churn Analysis

## I. Introduction

### 1. Introduction to Dataset

- User churn, in essence, is when customers or users of a product or service gradually become less engaged or stop using it, posing potential harm to a business.
- Grasping the underlying causes behind user churn can empower companies to formulate tactics for customer retention and enhance their overall product or service.
- Within the dataset, there is a **dimension table** housing data about customers in a telecommunications network company. This table encompasses demographic details as well as **churn-related information for each user**.

## IV. Insights


- Our competitors are currently outpacing us with superior offers and pricing.
- Regrettably, our customer service falls short, leading churned customers to experience a significantly higher average call rate of 2.4 compared to the average.
- Within the customer segment utilizing 0 - 10 GB of monthly downloads while subscribing to the Unlimited Data plan, we observe a higher churn rate than in other segments.
- Customers on "month-to-month" contracts exhibit an alarming churn rate of nearly 90%.

## V. Recommendations

- Enhancing Customer Service: Streamline the issue resolution process to swiftly address customer concerns and prevent repetitive calls without issue resolution.
- Implement a Comprehensive Support System: It is imperative to establish both online and telephone consultation services to effectively address customer problems.
- Retaining Month-to-Month Subscribers: Provide incentives and exclusive data packages for customers on month-to-month contracts to encourage their continued loyalty.
- Improving Unlimited Data Plans: Consider revising pricing for unlimited data plans or introducing preferential data packages tailored for users consuming 0 to 10 GB monthly.
- Attracting and Retaining Customers: Develop enticing promotions for new customers while also rewarding and expressing gratitude to loyal customers. A significant portion of customer churn, approximately 45%, is attributed to competitors outperforming our company.
