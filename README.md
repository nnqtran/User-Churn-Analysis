## IV. Insights

- Competitors have better offers + prices than our company.
- Our customer service is not good, churn customers have a much higher avg customer service call rate = 2.4 than average.
- Customers who use 0 - 10 gb of monthly download and subscribe to Unlimited Data plan have a higher churn rate than the rest of the group.
- Customers with "month to month" contracts have a high churn rate of almost 90%.

## V. Recommendations

- Need to improve customer service: optimize the problem-solving process: quickly for customers, avoid the situation that customers call many times without solving the problem.
- It is necessary to have online + phone consultants to solve the problems that customers encounter
- Customers who sign up for a month to month contract need to have incentives for: top up, preferential data packages to retain this group of customers.
- Need to improve the unlimited data package in terms of price or create a really preferential data package for the group of customers who need to use from 0 to 10 gb monthly.
- Create great offers for new customers, but also have incentives and gratitude for loyal customers, but customers churn because competitors are better than our company 45% of the reason for churn.
